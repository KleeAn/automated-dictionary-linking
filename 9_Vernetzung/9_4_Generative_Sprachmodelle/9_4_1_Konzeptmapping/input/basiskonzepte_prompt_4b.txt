f"""
Given are a dictionary entry with its headword and its definition.

Choose the **most appropriate** concept from the following list.

If only one concept clearly fits best: return **only this single** concept.

If lemma and definition are ambiguous and match multiple concepts, then distinguish:

a) If the ambiguity comes from an explicit enumeration in the definition (e.g., 'Wein oder Bier'), return *all these concepts*, separated by ‘;’.
b) If the ambiguity is uncertain or you cannot clearly decide which concept is meant, return **only the higher-level generic concept**.

Return **exactly** the complete name from the list, including all levels, separated by dots (e.g., 'Getränk.Kaltgetränk. Alkoholhaltiges_Kaltgetränk.Spirituose‘).

Each concept contains example terms: {konzeptliste}

**Dictionary entry**:
Headword: {lemma}
Definition: {definition}

Your entire answer must consist **only** of one or more of these concept names, without justification, explanation, or additional text.
