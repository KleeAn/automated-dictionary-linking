LK00026	Kaffeebinz	Substantiv	Kaffeekanne	kein_Trinken	[ungültig]	"Getränk

The headword ""Kaffeebinz"" is a dialectal term for a coffee pot or Kaffeekanne. Since it refers to a specific type of beverage container rather than the action of drinking, the state of thirst, or the drink itself, it aligns most closely with the category that includes specific types or groups of beverages, which in this context would be ""Getränk"" as it encompasses vessels used for preparing and serving such drinks. However, given the precise categorization requested, since ""Kaffeebinz"" is directly related to a type of beverage container used specifically for coffee, and not listed under typical examples for actions or states, the closest category provided is ""Getränk"", acknowledging the nuances in categorizing items closely associated with specific beverages."
LK00032	Kaffeehôr	Substantiv	(eigentl. Kaffeehorn) Kaffeeschwester	kein_Trinken	Getränk	"Getränk

The term ""Kaffeehôr"" (or properly spelled as ""Kaffeehorn"") seems to refer to a type or container for coffee, which falls under the category of beverages or types of drinks. Hence, it is best categorized as **Getränk**. However, considering its definition links to ""Kaffeeschwester,"" which could be related to a person in the context of serving coffee, there's an argument to categorize this entry as ""other"". Yet, based on the primary aspect of what Kaffeehorn directly implies (a container specifically for coffee), it aligns most closely with **Getränk**."
LK00034	Kaffeesatz	Substantiv	Kaffeesatz	kein_Trinken	[ungültig]	"other

LK00038	Kaffeetût	Substantiv	Kaffeeschwester	kein_Trinken	[ungültig]	"Getränk

The term ""Kaffeetût"" seems to be a playful or dialectal way to refer to a coffee-related item. Given that it includes the word ""Kaffee,"" which directly relates to a specific type of beverage, and assuming ""Tût"" is meant to be something like ""Tüte"" (bag), this likely refers to some form of packaging for coffee to be brewed as a drink. Therefore, it fits best into the **Getränk** category, which includes specific types or groups of beverages."
