This is a specific type of liquid that can be considered in relation to beverages but isn't typically categorized under standard drinks like water or coffee. It's more of a dairy byproduct.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Headword and Definition:** ""Wässich"" is defined as whey, the watery part of milk.
2. **Evaluate Categories:**
   - **Trinken (Drinking):** This category focuses on actions related to drinking, not substances themselves. So it doesn't fit here.
   - **Durst (Thirst):** Refers to the state of being thirsty, which is unrelated to whey.
   - **Getränk (Beverage):** Typically includes drinks like water, coffee, etc. Whey can be consumed but is more specific and not a standard beverage.
   - **Other:** Covers components or byproducts related to beverages, fitting ""Wässich"" as it's part of milk processing.

3. **Conclusion:** Since ""Wässich"" is a component rather than a typical drink, it fits best under the ""other"" category.
